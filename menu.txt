APPETIZERS
Samosas contain a small amount of spicy potato or meat filling that is then wrapped in dough and deep-fried until crispy and flaky.

Vadas are deep-fried fritters or flattened patties of potato, and a pav is just a dinner roll. 

BREADS
Naan is one of the most popular Indian flatbreads. To make naan, wheat flour dough is prepared either by allowing it to rise using yeast or by the addition of yogurt to the dough. That dough is then rolled into flatbreads and cooked in an Indian oven called a tandoor.

Paratha is a flatbread that is layered and pan-fried. They are made with wheat flour, and ghee or oil is smeared between layers of dough while rolling them.
In a stuffed paratha, the filling is stuffed into a ball of dough and then rolled into a flatbread.

Aloo Paratha: With spicy potato filling
Gobi Paratha: With spicy cauliflower filling
Vegetable Paratha: With a variety of vegetables stuffed
